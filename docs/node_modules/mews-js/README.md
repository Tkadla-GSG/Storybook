# MewsJs

MewsJs is a collection of common components and utils.

## Project Structure

## Development

### Summary

1. Select new version based on the changes you want to implement.
2. Select correct branch based according to the new version. 
3. Commit your changes, directly or through PR. Increment the version as part of your changes.
4. If the build is ok, TeamCity will publish the package to repository.
5. 

### Versioning

Versioning of MewsJs is based on Semantic Versioning ([semver](http://semver.org/)). The version number is composed from three parts - Major.Minor.Patch (i.e. 3.12.4). When you create a new version, you choose the appropriate category based on the changes. Choose:

- Major when there are backwards incompatible (breaking) changes.
- Minor when you add a new functionality, which is backwards compatible.
- Patch when you do backwards compatible bug fixes.

This version is set in `package.json` file. When you need to increment it, you can use `npm version (major|minor|patch)` command.

#### Patch

Patching can contain fixes of public api, changes to internal funcionality, etc.  
Patch version must be a single commit and done directly without a PR.  

#### Minor

Minor version must be done in a PR, so patching of current version can happen until the version is approved.

#### Major

When creating a major version, a new base branch must be created (i.e. for version 3.0.0, create branch 3.x.x). This allows a continuation of patch and minor version to be released in previous (2.x.x) branch. Based on the new branch a PR must be done, so the initial commit can be squashed when the version is approved.

### Publishing

Publishing is done automatically by TeamCity when a new version passes the build.
